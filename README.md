<h2>How to play even odd game?</h2>
<p dir="auto">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The player who owns the right to move must guess the even or odd number of balls in the second players hand. If he guesses correctly, he takes as many balls from the second player as he himself holds. And vice versa - if he does not guess, he gives as many balls as the second has in his hand.</p>
