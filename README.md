<p dir="auto"><h2>The game was based on the serial  "Game of squid" and the game's rules.</h2></p>
<h2>How to play even odd game?</h2>
<p dir="auto">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The player who owns the right to move must guess the even or odd number of balls in the second players hand. If he guesses correctly, he takes as many balls from the second player as he himself holds. And vice versa - if he does not guess, he gives as many balls as the second has in his hand.</p>

<h2>Project Goals</h2>
<p dir="auto"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite interesting and, at the same time, a simple logic game. Try playing it with the computer.</p>

<p>Rules: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each player has 10 stones/balls/small items. Both players take several stones in their hand, squeeze it, and then stretch it forward. The player who owns the right to move must guess the even or odd number of stones in the second player's hand. If he guesses correctly, he takes as many stones from the second player as he himself holds. And vice versa - if he doesn’t guess, he gives as many stones as the second one has in his hand. The winner is the one who ends up with 20 stones.</p></p>
